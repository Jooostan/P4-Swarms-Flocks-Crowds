Title: Flock O' Sheep

Description: A flock of sheep using starter code from
https://github.com/julinas/p4-flocking-starter
I did my best to replicate that of a
herd of sheep. I wanted to recreate the clumping of the
sheep while also adding the element of a herding dog.

Additional Behaviors:
- Avoidance of the dog
- Attraction to tufts of grass

Additional Object Types:
- Dog
- Tufts of Grass

Artist Statement: I did my best to replicate what was
previously said in the description. I had some slight
difficulty with the collisions between my sheep,
resulting in some slight strange looking movement.
I did my best to alter this without breaking the
formation of larger herds.
